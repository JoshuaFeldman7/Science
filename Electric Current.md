When charges are moving that is a current

Electrons flow from the negative side of a battery to the positive
But we work with the old idea that current flows from the positive side of abattery to the negative side

In electricity:
  Current = the rate of flow of charge
In our analogy:
  Current =  the rate of flow of lorries = the number of lorries passing a certain point

**In a series circuit, the current is the same at every point in the circuit.**
**In a parallel circuit, the current splits at the junction and rejoins afterwards**

$\fracI = {Q}{T}$

1. 20A
2. 0.03A
3. 6C
4. 10s
5. 16C
6. 4 x 10^20

Current = Charge / Time
Amps = Coulombs / seconds
