When charges are moving that is a current

Electrons flow from the negative side of a battery to the positive
But we work with the old idea that current flows from the positive side of abattery to the negative side

In electricity:
  Current = the rate of flow of charge
In our analogy:
  Current =  the rate of flow of lorries = the number of lorries passing a certain point

*In a series circuit, the current is the same at every point in the circuit.*
