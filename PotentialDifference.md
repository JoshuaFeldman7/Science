# Potential Difference

Potential Difference - The [[energy]] transferred to or from a component per unit [[charge]] - what does this mean?

Potential Difference is measured in [[volts]]

In a [[series circuit]], the potential difference from the [[battery]] must be equal to the potential difference given to each [[componenent]] added together.

In a [[parallel circuit]], the potential difference from the [[battery]] must be equal to the potential difference on each branch.

V = E / Q (make this a properly formatted equation)
Volts = Joules / Coulombs
PD = Energy / Charge


make excalidraw diagram of a series circuit with 1 light bulb and a 9V battery, 2 light bulbs and then 3 light bulbs. Show how the voltage is shared equally

make an excalidraw diagram of a parallel circuit with 2 light bulbs, a 9v battery and show how the voltage is 9v on both bulbs
