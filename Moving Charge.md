If an [[electrical charge]] is present, there must be an electric field.

[[Field]] lines always point from positive to negative

A force [[field]] is the area where an object could feel a force

If there is a difference in [[charge]] between 2 places, we say there is a [[potential difference]] in that region.

In a complete [[circuit]] a [[battery]] makes and electric [[field]] that goes all around the [[circuit]].

[[charge]] goes anti clockwise


All of the [[electrons]] in a [[circuit]] have an [[electric charge]] and are pushed towards the positive end of the battery. However only the outer electrons from metal [[atoms]] will be free to move. It is the [[chemical reaction]] inside a [[battery]] that creates a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other The bigger the [[potential difference]], the bigger the size of the [[charge]] at each end and the stronger the electric [[field]].
